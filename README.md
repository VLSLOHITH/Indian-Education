Utilizing Power BI for Analyzing the Indian Education System (Schools) through Visualization.

## Introduction
Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Indian Education System, focusing primarily on school details up to the secondary level, utilizing Power BI.
The data source utilized was the Open Government Data Platform India and it is from the year 2015-2016. The analysis was segmented into four main reports: 'Contribution of Females in Education,' 'Government versus Private Schools,'
'Schools by Facilities,' and 'Reserved Category in Upper Primary and Secondary Sections.' Each of these reports was further dissected on a per-state basis, with additional analysis conducted at the district level 
wherever district-wide information was available.
